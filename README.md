# Team J (Aaron and Tomiwa)

This repository contains code for the creation of a planner application for Android; to be used by students of any academic level to assist in organization of assignments and other responsibilities for all courses they are enrolled in.

## Functionality

### Iteration 1

The prototype developed as a part of the first iteration has the functionality to add tasks, add courses, view all tasks, view all courses, edit tasks, and edit courses.  

With tasks, you can give them the attributes of a:
* name
* type
* deadline
* corresponding course
* and personal notes

For courses, you can give them the attributes of a:
* name
* code
* corresponding semester
* meeting times

You can also show tasks corresponding to their associated course by selecting "all courses."

The main method to run the program is located within the Controller class.

### Iteration 2

For the second iteration, the code has been converted into an Android Studio application, with the task and course functionality implemented. On a cold boot, the application defaults to opening the Task Pane.

For the view of the task pane, you can navigate to the Add Task pane by clicking on the "plus" icon, which then allows you to create a task with the following attributes:
* Name
* Associated course
* Task type
* Deadline (date and time)
* Additional notes

Similarly, you can navigate to the Add Course pane when the Courses pane is active. Then, you can create a task with the following attributes:
* Name
* Course code
* Associated semester
* Meeting times
* Meeting days
* Start/end times
* Room number
* Additional notes

The main method to run the program is located within the MainActivity class.

### Iteration 3
