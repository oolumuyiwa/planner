# Vision Document

## High-Level Goal
The goal is to create an application that serves as a course planning app, where students can better manage their academic course load by proper planning and organization of tasks (such as assignments, readings, and exams) by various criteria such as due dates or by course. It will be an Android application written in Java, in which the only actor, in this case a student (K12 or higher education) will be able to add information from their syllabus or just general upcoming tasks and be able to view all upcoming tasks from all courses in one feed. 

## Features
The various features are:
- adding/removing/editing courses
  - this includes class times and location, as well as other notes
- adding/removing/editing/marking complete assignments and other academic tasks (readings, exams, etc.) 
  - this includes adding a due date or time
  - students will also be able to receive notifications prior to upcoming or late assignments
  - students will be able to mark an assignment as complete, moving it out of view

For the design, there will be two main view/panes: a course view as well as a task feed view. The course view will allow students to view their courses and the various tasks assigned to them, as well as supplementary information about the courses. The task feed will show only tasks, sorted according to due dates similar to that of Google Calendars.

## Constraints
This application will be made for Android only.

## Business Case
There are no plans to profitize this application. We are trying to provide a way for students to better manage their academic course load.
