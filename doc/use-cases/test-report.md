A short test report describing how the prototype was tested. For system tests, this should be a textual description of the inputs provided to the system, the outputs received, and whether they match expectations (feel free to include screenshots). Unit tests will not be required for this iteration. If you want to include them, provide the name of the test class(es), which will then describe the tests using Javadoc (I wrote a JUnit in IntelliJ tutorial, which you may find useful)
