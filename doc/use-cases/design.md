Need to produce:
* A domain model depicting the relevant domain concepts and their associations. Please note it doesn't need to be perfect - don't spend too much time on it: use it as a starting point and move on. Focus on what you need to create the functionality chosen for iteration 1 and omit the rest. Write it as PlantUML in a file with path doc/design.md. 
* Sequence diagrams for the most important operations. This will help uncover the necessary methods. Again, focus on what is need for iteration 1. Make them be part of the doc/design.md file. 
* A class diagram for the slice of the system under design. Once again, omit things that aren't needed for the first iteration. Make it be part of the doc/design.md file.
