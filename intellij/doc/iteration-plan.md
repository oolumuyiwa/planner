# Iteration plans
## Iteration 1 plan:
The primary focus for the first iteration would be on the following use cases, in order of importance:
* **adding tasks**: the task is the core component of the application, without which there would be little purpose. Adding the task permits for further refinement and other features to be build upon its framework.
* **add course time (due dates)**: this use case builds off of the core functionality of the task itself, so it is secondary in importance.
* **adding/editing courses**: while tasks would be organized partially according to their corresponding course, this use case is not as important as having the core functionality present.

## Iteration 2 plan:
The primary focus for the second iteration would be, in order of importance:
* **bug fixes**: some exceptions are thrown with incorrect user input, and those should be caught. Some of these exceptions are marked with TODOs in the code comments
* **removing course meeting time**: giving the user the ability to remove/change the meeting time of a course.
* **sorting task by deadline**: giving the user the ability to sort their tasks chronologically, useful for 'Calendar View'
* **sorting meeting times by date**: giving the user the ability to sort their classes chronologically.


## Iteration 3 plan:
The primary focus for the third iteration would be, in order of importance:
* **data persistence:** allowing for information added to be saved over multiple app launches.
* **bug fixes/ui updating:** the view/form for adding courses/tasks is unintuitive for seeing what information is required and must be added, more information on incorrect data entry should be given.
* **other features:** adding semester and notification functionality, among others.
